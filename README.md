- 👋🏾 Well hello there ... I am KaveriK the Kodda
- // ... my non-koding companions call me Kuda or Kav.
- 
- 🌱 Right now, I'm studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in Robotics & Intelligent Systems
- ... with a minor in Global Economics & Management.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in:
      + Artificial Intelligence (and it's subset, Machine Learning),
      + 3D Art and Modelling (Blender3D & Unity3D)
      + XR and its subsets (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality & Mixed Reality)
- .. and the applications of these in the Creative Industry
-
- See, I've also produced & composed Music since 2016, and I've done Graphic Design since 2020.
- My mission is to find and explore the intersections between technology and "all things creative".
- 
- 💞️ I love to work & collaborate on projects that involve Technology & Creativity.
- 📫 If you'd like to reach me, catch me on Linkedin @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/mk-mandaza-000/
